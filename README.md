THE FOLLOWING SKETCHES DESCRIBED HERE CONTROL THEIR RESPECTIVE ESP BOARDS BY WEB BROWSER, NOT BY SERIAL MONITOR.
SERIAL MONITORS NEVER EVEN ENTER THE PICTURE HERE.
AND THEY WERE WRITTEN/CREATED AND COMPILE WITH THE ARDUINO 1.8.8 IDE.
THE BOARDS WERE ALL PURCHASED ON AliExpress i.e. ESP32-CAM at https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803285802793.html
REFER TO THE "READ ME FIRST" FILES FOR THE SPECIFIC ARDUINO IDE SETTINGS.
NOTE THAT CERTAIN OBSCURE ESP32-CAM ESP BOARDS WILL NOT WORK. ALL THE BOARDS I BOUGHT FROM AliExpress have worked.

"Working_ESP32_CAM_BEST_DOES_EVERYTHING_V10.zip" <<=This sketch displays multiple ESP32-CAMS, has LED FLASH CONTROL, has OTA capability, all rendered on a webpage on your browser (https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803285802793.html for which cam board to buy). 
This sketch has a very nice web browser User Interface.

"Working_NodeMCU_CONTROL_by_BROWSER_V2.14.ino" <<=This sketch displays and controls various sensors by browser on various webpages.
It also supports SD CARD in which you can type (enter) and store, edit, delete, and search text records remotely by web browser.
Senors supported are humidity, temperature, light (lux), barometric air pressure, gases.
It also supports OTA. And it can control on/off switch remotely by your web broswer.
This sketch has a very nice web browser User Interface.
This sketch is for the NodeMCU ESP8266 board.


- I’m interested in Web-based systems/electronics and sensors, security, video, movies, android and pc platforms, wifi, otg, php.
- I do not believe in taking the "pain route" with any projects. Therefore, I detest Linux. 
- I find it sad that the modern world is based on the inefficient, threaded C (+ ++) programming language. Very unfortunate.
- Bjarne Stroustrup himself,the creator of C++, admitted in his book, "The Design and Evolution of C++," that C++ is the worst computer language imaginable.
- That it is just a patchwork of hodge-podge, thrown together attempts, and that it is not a true compiler and only compiles part of the code submitted to it.
- Consequently, this is why the Internet, written in C, is so slow, unstable, and a security nightmare.
