- I’m interested in Web-based systems/electronics and sensors, security, video, movies, android and pc platforms, wifi, otg, php.
- I do not believe in taking the "pain route" with any projects. Therefore, I detest Linux. 
- I find it sad that the modern world is based on the inefficient, threaded C (+ ++) programming language. Very unfortunate.
- Bjarne Stroustrup himself,the creator of C++, admitted in his book, "The Design and Evolution of C++," that C++ is the worst computer language imaginable.
- That it is just a patchwork of hodge-podge, thrown together attempts, and that it is not a true compiler and only compiles part of the code submitted to it.
- Consequently, this is why the Internet, written in C, is so slow, unstable, and a security nightmare.
